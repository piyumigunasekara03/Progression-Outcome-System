Real-Time Ticketing System

Introduction

The Ticket Management System is a real-time application that simulates a ticketing process for customers and vendors. Customers purchase tickets while vendors replenish the ticket pool, all while respecting the system's maximum capacity constraints. The system demonstrates concurrency, logging, and thread-safe operations in a controlled environment.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Ensure that the following tools and frameworks are installed on your system:

Node.js: Version 18.x or later

npm: Version 9.x or later (bundled with Node.js)

Java (Optional): If integrating with Java-based tools, version 11 or later

Text Editor or IDE: VS Code or any other preferred code editor

Git: For cloning the repository

A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
